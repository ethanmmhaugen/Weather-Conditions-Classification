# Weather-Conditions-Classification
### Overview
Performed PCA and Randomized PCA and trained a CNN to achieve 85% accuracy in identifying different types of weather, a huge improvement over K-nearest neighbors classification which only achieved 63% accuracy. We then decided to take it a step further and do transfer learning starting with a pre-trained Resnet model and fine-tuning it to our data. This strategy yielded a 97.33% accuracy score.
